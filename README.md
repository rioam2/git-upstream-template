Synchronize git templates generated by GitHub as if they were forks.

```bash
npx git-upstream-template <source-template-repo-url> [optional-branch-name]
```

### Options

- `--exclude <regex>`, `-e <regex>` Regular expression for excluding commits from list of updates based on their commit message

on an child instance of a Github template repository will open up an interactive CLI where you can select from a list of updated commits that have been made after child instance creation. These will then be applied to the child template instance keeping changes and patches current.

All working directory changes will be stashed before any operations are made using git and popped once successfully completed. This is for your own peace-of-mind and protection. If any operation fails, simply use `git stash pop` to retrieve your cwd again.

Special treatment will be given to source commits with messages formatted: `Bump <package> from <src_version> to <dst_version>`. These commits will call `yarn` to update `<package>` to version `<dst_version>`.

### Optional Branch Name

In order to support newly created repositories on GitHub you can pass an `<optional-branch-name>` in your CLI. All newly created GitHub repositories will have a default branch of `main` instead of `master`.
